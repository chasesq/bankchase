## Environment Variables Configured

```
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN          # Cloudflare API token (set in Vercel)
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID          # Cloudflare account ID (set in Vercel)
METICULOUS_RECORDING_TOKEN     # Meticulous recording token (set in Vercel)

CLOUDFLARE_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY # R2 secret key (set in Vercel)
CLOUDFLARE_R2_BUCKET_NAME     # R2 bucket name (set in Vercel)
```

All environment variables are securely stored in Vercel project settings and automatically available at runtime.

---

## Testing & Verification

### Verified Working ✅

✅ Meticulous recorder script loads in development  
✅ Dev server compiles without errors  
✅ DNS API responds with proper validation  
✅ R2 API routes accessible  
✅ Environment variables properly configured  
✅ DNS dashboard components render correctly  
✅ API authentication chain working  
✅ Error handling implemented  
✅ AWS SDK packages installed successfully  
✅ Build successful with zero errors

### Manual Testing Recommended

1. Create a test DNS record
2. Verify it appears in Cloudflare dashboard
3. Edit the record and confirm update
4. Delete the record and confirm removal
5. Upload a test file to R2 storage
6. Verify file appears in Cloudflare dashboard
7. Test Meticulous recorder by user interaction

---

## Security Considerations

### Implemented Security

1. **API Token Storage**: All credentials in environment variables
2. **Client-Side Protection**: Tokens never exposed to browser
3. **Server-Side Validation**: All inputs validated before Cloudflare API calls
4. **Error Handling**: Sensitive errors logged server-side, user-friendly messages shown
5. **Authentication**: Clerk authentication protects admin routes
6. **HTTPS Only**: All external API calls over HTTPS

### Recommended Actions ⚠️

1. **Rotate Exposed Credentials**
   - The Cloudflare API token was exposed in initial documentation
   - The R2 secret key was exposed
   - Both should be rotated immediately at cloudflare.com

2. **Production Security**
   - Use separate API tokens for staging/production
   - Enable MFA on Cloudflare account
   - Regularly audit API token usage
   - Use separate R2 buckets for environments
   - Implement request rate limiting
   - Enable API token IP whitelisting

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Required)

  -d '{"fromAccountId":"...","toAccountNumber":"...","toBankCode":"...","amount":100,"currency":"USD"}'
```

### 2. Poll Status
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/transfers/status?transactionId=<ID>
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/payment-provider \
  -H "x-provider-name: swift" \
  -d '{"event_id":"...","transaction_id":"<ID>","status":"delivered"}'
```

### 4. Send SMS Alert
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/sms/alert \

   - Monitor SMS delivery rates

3. **Run Load Tests**
   - Test with 1000 concurrent transfers
   - Verify idempotency under load
   - Check database performance

4. **User Communication**
